ECE471 HW5 -- Fall 2020

Name: John Bowen


7.	Describe what your "something cool" code does
	My something cool was displaying 'ECE 471' on the display, having it scroll from right to left. 

8.
 a). Pre-RPi4, the GPU is in charge of the initial boot process. This is unusual for ARM boards.  
 b). The '/boot' partition on the RPi is a FAT32 filesystem because it is simple and low-memory (easy 
     for bootloader).
 c). The generic name for the code/program responsible for loading the OS is the 'bootloader'.
 d). After running 'i2cdetect', addresses 0-2 and 0x78-0x7f are not scanned because they are reserved for
     other components.

9.
 a). 94 detect_final.c 
 b). 45 lines
