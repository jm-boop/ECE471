John Bowen
ECE 471
Homework #2



1.
	Linux is installed and working.

2.
	The assignment was copied to my RPi with:
	$ wget http://web.eece.maine.edu/~vweaver/classes/ece471/ece471_hw2_code.tar.gz		

3.
	The files were unpacked with:
	$ tar -xzvf ece471_hw2_code.tar.gz

4.
	The files were built with 'make'.

5.
***********hello_world.c***********

#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
	
	int i;
	
	// Iteratively print 12 lines to the terminal
	for (i = 0; i < 12; i++) {
		printf("#%d: ECE471 This is line numero %d!\n", i + 1, i + 1);
	}

	return 0;
}

6.
**********something_cool.c*********

#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
	
	int i;
	int j = 1;
	
	// Print each line a different color using ANSI escape codes and an iterator
	for (i = 0; i < 12; i++) {
		if (j == 8) {
			j = 1;
		}
		
		printf("\x1b[3%dm#%d: ECE471 This is line numero %d!\n", j, i + 1, i + 1);

		j++;
	}

	return 0;
}

7.
a)
	$ man ls
b)
		
	The command:
	$ ls -a
	will list information of ALL files, the '-a' makes the command not ignore files starting with '.'.
c)
	One reason C is often used in embedded systems is that it is a language close to the hardware.
	It has 'all the power of assembly' (which is even closer to the hardware), but much easier to follow.
d)
	I'm using a monitor, keyboard, and mouse to connect to my RPi3. I'm copying files from the network
	using the 'wget' command.

8.
	Work has been submitted.
