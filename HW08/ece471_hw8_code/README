3. Describe your something cool:
	My something cool was the easy method of converting the temperature to Fahrenheit and Kelvin,
	and displaying it along with the Celsius reading.


4. a. We powered the DS18B20 sensor with the external power supply of +3.3V so that we didn't need 
      an external MOSFET pullup in order to assure sufficient supply current to the sensor when temperature
      conversions are taking place.
   b. If I wanted to connect my pi to a temperature probe 100 yards away, I would choose the 1-wire interface
      because bus wires can go up to 300m, while SPI and I2C busses can only be a few meters.
